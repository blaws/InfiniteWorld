This project generates terrain meshes using a randomized recursive 
algorithm, then orients and regenerates them so that the user can never 
reach the edge of the "map"

Controls:
Arrow keys - move view
WASD keys - orient view
'-', '=' - move camera up/down
'[', ']', '\' - increase/decrease/toggle distance view limit
Enter key - toggle view mode (fill, outline)
ESC key - quit program

Developed on Mac OSX 10.9
